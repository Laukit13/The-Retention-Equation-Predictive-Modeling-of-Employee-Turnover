# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for employee attrition, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and factors that contribute to employee turnover.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. Key milestones and features will be added incrementally as the project progresses.

## Features (Planned)

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Deployment of the prediction model
- Dashboard for visualizing attrition trends and predictions

## Next Steps

- [ ] Data collection and cleaning
- [ ] Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Feature selection and engineering
- [ ] Model building and testing
